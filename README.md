# RPS-Multiplayer

This is an online version of Rock, Paper, Scissors that allows two users 
to play against each other and chat.

The front end uses javascript and jquery with Google Firebase serving as
a backend/server to display the chat to both players simultaneously.

This app is deployed on github.io so you feel free to challenge a friend
as well as gloat when you beat them!
